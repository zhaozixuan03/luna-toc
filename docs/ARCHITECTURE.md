# ChatTOC Architecture

This document describes the design, context boundaries, and module coordination of the ChatTOC Chrome extension.

## Overview

ChatTOC is a Chrome Extension that inserts a table-of-contents sidebar into ChatGPT's chat interface, helping users navigate long conversations and keep track of prompts.

---

## 1. Context Boundaries & Injection Model

Because Chrome Extensions run content scripts in an **Isolated World** (preventing direct access to the page's Javascript variables and window functions), ChatTOC splits its logic into two execution worlds:

### Platform Abstraction

- Every host LunaTOC supports is described by a `Platform` record exported from [`src/platforms/platformInterface.ts`](../src/platforms/platformInterface.ts). Each record carries its own `pageHook`, `navigation`, `routing`, `contentCapture`, `diagnostics`, `config`, `messages`, `runtimeConfigKey`, and optional `theme`.
- [`getActivePlatform()`](../src/platforms/index.ts) is the only host-detection call in the codebase. It runs once at startup, walks the `PLATFORMS` registry, and returns the adapter whose `matches` accept `window.location.host`. Any module that needs platform-specific behavior calls `getActivePlatform()` and consumes `platform.*` fields rather than importing from `src/platforms/<host>/`.
- ChatGPT lives under [`src/platforms/chatgpt/`](../src/platforms/chatgpt/); it wraps the existing modules instead of rewriting them so behavior is unchanged. A [`src/platforms/copilot/`](../src/platforms/copilot/) placeholder exists where every method throws `Error('Copilot platform not yet implemented')` — see [ADR 11](DECISIONS.md#adr-11-platform-abstraction-interface).
- `APP_CONFIG` exposes a `Record<PlatformId, PlatformConfigBlock>`; `navigationAlgorithm`, `promptTopOffsetPx`, `settleAttempts`, `backfillMaxPages`, `interceptFetchNumTurns`, contract slots, and DOM selectors are all per-platform.

### Main World (`pageHook.iife.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Declared as a `MAIN` world IIFE content script and injected by Chrome at `document_start`. It resolves the active platform via `getActivePlatform()` and dispatches every hook concern through the platform adapter, intercepting the host's own native API calls and events.
- **Responsibilities**:
  1. **Fetch Hooking**: Overrides `window.fetch` to delegate request inspection and bumping to `platform.contentCapture.inspectFetchRequest` and `platform.pageHook.fetch.maybeBumpFetch`. The platform adapter decides which request shapes matter and how to read the conversation ID from the path.
  2. **History Hooking**: Overrides `history.pushState` and `history.replaceState` to notify the content script of SPA route transitions using `platform.messages.routeChanged`.
  3. **Media Query Spoofing**: Calls `platform.pageHook.installMatchMediaSpoof()` and `installMatchMediaToggleListener()` — for ChatGPT this proxies `window.matchMedia` and responsive listeners to fake a wide viewport (e.g. `1400px`), forcing the host's React app to keep its native navigation buttons mounted even when the user resizes or splits their screen. Other hosts may throw or no-op here until implemented.

### Isolated World (Content Scripts)

- **Purpose**: `src/content.ts` is declared in `manifest.json` and runs in a sandboxed context where it can access the DOM and Chrome APIs but not ChatGPT's global JavaScript scope.
- **Loading**: `src/content.ts` starts the application shell, and each module imports its explicit dependencies. Vite bundles that graph into one generated Content Script; only the entry remains in the source Manifest.

### React UI Foundation

- React is introduced incrementally: existing DOM-driven features remain unchanged until their individual UI boundaries are migrated.
- [components/ui](../src/components/ui) contains shadcn/ui primitives; feature-specific and shared React components will live in sibling component directories.
- [reactHost.tsx](../src/reactHost/reactHost.tsx) owns the React Shadow Root, injects the compiled Tailwind stylesheet, and exposes the internal Portal container.
- [PromptEditorDialog.tsx](../src/components/my-prompts/PromptEditorDialog.tsx) renders the first migrated My Prompts interface while saving remains in the feature layer.
- [PromptAutocomplete.tsx](../src/components/my-prompts/PromptAutocomplete.tsx) renders matched prompts at viewport coordinates supplied by the composer feature and keeps a single highlight owned by the most recent pointer or keyboard interaction.
- [PopupApp.tsx](../src/components/popup/PopupApp.tsx) renders the extension Popup, including the follow-ChatGPT and manual theme controls.
- The Popup also selects the color palette, edits Custom colors, and clears persisted Smart Labels.
- [OptionsApp.tsx](../src/components/options/OptionsApp.tsx) renders the ChatGPT navigation strategy setting as immediately saved radio cards.
- Popup layout and component styling use Tailwind utilities; `popup.css` remains the Tailwind entry and retains only theme tokens and document-level base rules.
- `@/` resolves to the entire `src/` directory for browser code, React components, styles, and utilities.
- Tailwind CSS is loaded as an inline string inside the React Shadow Root, so generated global rules cannot affect ChatGPT or the legacy Content Script UI.
- shadcn theme variables are scoped to `.luna-toc-ui`, which is applied to both the React and Portal containers inside the Shadow Root.
- The React host mirrors the document's `data-theme` value onto itself so Shadow DOM components follow LunaTOC theme changes without selecting across the boundary.
- `data-palette` selects a color-token overlay independently of `data-theme`; Custom colors are validated opaque hex values applied through CSS variables.
- Smart Labels are display-only metadata. A unified resolver applies Raw/Smart mode, separate completion/compression decisions, source completion, revision-aware cache lookup, bounded local evidence, semantic guards, and reason-coded abstention. Navigation snapshots, Prompt IDs, and saved prompts continue to consume the original `NavigatorMessage`; search checks raw, semantic, and displayed labels, while hover previews retain the full semantic label and original Prompt.
- Only a candidate proven to originate from an Assistant Markdown heading may suppress that exact child-outline row. Ordinary sentence labels never remove outline content.
- Smart Label diagnostics are developer-only: the bounded trace buffer lives in memory, emits text-free console records only when `luna:debugSmartLabels` is explicitly enabled, and has no sidebar or end-user feedback surface.

### Build Outputs

- `src/config/config.ts` centralizes compile-time values intended for deliberate project tuning, including sidebar widths and a shared z-index base with semantic Sidebar, Toggle, Popover, and Modal offsets; runtime user preferences remain in their existing storage modules.
- `platforms.chatgpt.navigationAlgorithm` supplies the default `legacy-native` fallback, while `navigationSettings.ts` persists and synchronizes the user's runtime choice between native and independent navigation.
- `platforms.chatgpt.promptTopOffsetPx` keeps a small gap above prompts after independent navigation aligns them with the chat container's top edge.
- `platforms.chatgpt.settleAttempts` limits how many times independent navigation re-resolves a Prompt after ChatGPT replaces virtualized DOM.
- `navigation.search` bounds each virtual search by 32 total attempts and 4 seconds and stops response seeking earlier after 6 consecutive attempts without logical progress; unresolved positions use the same no-progress budget instead of a separate smaller limit.
- Confirmed and observed anchors participate only in the initial estimate; every later movement is relative to the current live scroll position.
- Response seeking estimates pixels per Prompt from consecutive observations, permits larger learned movements while far from the target, restores a smaller cap near the target, grows the step when the visible Prompt does not change, and halves the previous step after crossing the target.
- An unresolved observation at the top or bottom scroll boundary always moves inward before position recognition resumes, and that inward direction continues across consecutive unresolved viewports rather than returning to the stale outward direction.
- Prompt mounting is an isolated feedback scan: repeated target-response observations grow the step, crossing into the previous response reverses and halves it, and neighboring responses never return control to response seeking.
- Prompt snapshot revisions retain the previous complete Fingerprint and Segment indexes while replacements build, then swap in matching-revision results so navigation never observes an avoidable empty-index window.

### Navigation Diagnostics

Independent ChatGPT navigation supports temporary runtime diagnostics through
page `localStorage`. Enable structured, text-free jump events with:

```js
localStorage.setItem('chatTocDebugJump', '1');
location.reload();
```

Each event is written both as an expandable console object and as a
`[LunaTOC navigation JSON]` line whose complete fields survive copied or saved
console logs. `PROMPT_MOUNT_EXHAUSTED` adds text-free ChatGPT DOM evidence:
mounted and visible user-message IDs, exact target-ID candidates, matched
Assistant nodes, their inferred navigator indexes and target-text-match flags,
and their connection, visibility, and geometry state.

Per-Prompt Assistant Outline diagnostics use a separate opt-in switch and may
include extracted heading text:

```js
localStorage.setItem('chatTocDebugOutline', '1');
location.reload();
```

Remove `chatTocDebugOutline` and reload to stop Outline logging.

Override selected test parameters without rebuilding:

```js
localStorage.setItem(
  'chatTocNavigationTestConfig',
  JSON.stringify({
    settleWaitMs: 300,
    settleAttempts: 5,
    maxSearchAttempts: 12,
    maxUnproductiveSearchAttempts: 6,
    maxSearchDurationMs: 3000,
    useConfirmedAnchors: false,
    useObservedAnchors: true,
  })
);
location.reload();
```

Remove both keys and reload to restore project defaults. Diagnostics include
IDs, indexes, anchor sources, plans, and geometry, but never Prompt or response
text.
- Pure logic tests live under `test/`, run with Vitest in a Node environment, and use the same `@/` source alias as browser code.
- DOM-dependent platform adapter tests opt into jsdom per test file; other tests remain in the default Node environment.
- `manifest.json` is the source Manifest and authoritative extension version.
- `vite.config.ts` uses Vite and CRXJS to discover extension entries and cleans source extensions from generated entry names after CRXJS finishes writing the build.
- `dist/manifest.json` is generated for Chrome and rewrites source entry paths to built assets.
- `dist/` is generated and ignored by Git; run `npm run build` before loading or packaging the extension.
- All executable files under `src/` are TypeScript; Chrome runs only the JavaScript generated in `dist/`.
- `src/content.ts` starts both the legacy application shell and the isolated React host; the Tailwind entry is imported only by the React host using Vite's `?inline` query.
- `scripts/version.ts` is executed through `tsx`, while `tsconfig.node.json` strictly checks Node-side tooling separately from browser code.

## 2. Communication Protocol

Data flows from the page's Hook script to the content script using window messages. Channel names are platform-namespaced — every adapter exposes its own set through `Platform.messages`, so two adapters can never collide. ChatGPT currently publishes:

- `CHATGPT_CONVERSATION_DATA`: Sends the full JSON conversation tree on page load or full conversation update.
- `CHATGPT_NEW_USER_MESSAGE`: Streams newly submitted user prompts in real-time.
- `CHATGPT_ROUTE_CHANGED`: Dispatched instantly when a routing URL transition takes place.
- `CHATGPT_NAVIGATOR_SET_WIDTH_SPOOF`: Sent from the content script to toggle media query spoofing on/off when the sidebar visibility state toggles.
- `LUNA_CHATGPT_CONFIG_UPDATE`: Sent from the content script to publish effective contract values back to the page-hook so detection can compare observed requests against the developer's active expectations.
- `LUNA_CONTRACT_MISMATCH`: Sent from the page-hook to the content script when an observed contract slot no longer matches the expected value.

Adding a new platform means publishing a parallel `COPILOT_*` (or `CLAUDE_*`, etc.) set through its own `messages` record.
