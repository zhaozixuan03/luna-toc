# Architectural Decisions Log

This document records the key architectural decisions, rationale, and consequences for ChatTOC.

---

## ADR 01: Session-Bound State Storage (sessionStorage)
* **Date**: 2026-06-19

### Context
We needed to decide how to persist user-facing state, including marked/starred prompts, sidebar pin status, and the floating toggle button's dragged coordinates. The manifest requested the `"storage"` extension permission, but it was unused.

### Decision
Keep all state stored in standard browser `sessionStorage` (scoped to the tab session) rather than migrating to persistent `chrome.storage.local`. 

### Rationale
These states are intentionally designed to be session-bound and scoped to the active tab. Storing them permanently across browser restarts or sharing them globally across tabs is undesirable for the desired UX of this extension.

### Consequences
* The unused `"storage"` permission was removed from `manifest.json` to prevent Chrome Web Store review warnings/rejections.
* Marked prompts and positions will continue to reset when the tab is closed.
* Sidebar pin status is shared by every conversation in the same tab session;
  switching conversations or creating a conversation from a new chat does not
  change it.

---

## ADR 02: Event-Driven SPA Routing Detection
* **Date**: 2026-06-19

### Context
ChatGPT is a Single Page Application (SPA). To refresh the sidebar when a user clicks a different conversation, the content script previously ran a `setInterval` polling check on `location.pathname` every 250ms.

### Decision
Hijack the HTML5 History API (`history.pushState` and `history.replaceState`) in the main page context (`pageHook.js`) and notify the content script via `window.postMessage`, combined with a standard `'popstate'` listener in `content.js` for browser navigation.

### Rationale
Polling timers keep the CPU awake, which degrades system idle states and laptop battery life. Event-driven hooks execute 0% code when idle, and trigger the refresh instantly without the up to 250ms lag of polling.

### Consequences
* The polling timer was completely removed from the codebase.
* Router updates are now instantaneous and zero-overhead.

---

## ADR 03: Fallback Navigation Without Native Prompt Buttons
* **Date**: 2026-06-19
* **Updated**: 2026-06-27

### Context
If ChatGPT's native navigation outline buttons cannot be found in the DOM, jumping to the top or bottom of the chat fell back to `window.scrollTo`. However, ChatGPT locks the page window height at `100vh` and scrolls a nested division container instead. Thus, `window.scrollTo` had no scrolling effect.

ChatGPT can also virtualize long conversations before its native prompt navigator appears. In that state, only a subset of user prompt nodes exists in the DOM, so index-based `scrollIntoView()` fallbacks can target the wrong rendered prompt or fail to find the target.

### Decision
Keep ChatGPT's native prompt navigator as the preferred path whenever its buttons exist.

When native prompt buttons are unavailable:

* Top/bottom controls scroll the detected ChatGPT scroll container directly to its absolute edge.
* Text prompt navigation first tries to match currently rendered DOM text, then performs a bounded virtual-list scan by scrolling until the target prompt text is rendered.
* Index-based DOM fallback is only used when all conversation prompts are currently rendered.

### Rationale
Native prompt buttons remain the only reliable way to navigate virtualized file/image prompts, so they stay first priority. Direct scroll-container edge jumps are more reliable than `scrollIntoView()` when the first or last prompt is not currently rendered. Text-based bounded scanning handles the virtualized/no-native-TOC gap without relying on inaccurate scroll-height ratios.

### Consequences
* Top/bottom fallback works even when the first or last prompt is not mounted in the DOM.
* Text prompt fallback can navigate through virtualized conversations when native prompt buttons are absent.
* File/image prompt navigation remains limited without ChatGPT's native prompt buttons because those prompts lack a stable text anchor.

### Independent Navigation Development Mode

ChatGPT navigation is selected by
the runtime preference stored by `navigationSettings.ts`. The default
`legacy-native` strategy preserves the native-button and legacy scan behavior,
and the full-page extension Options UI can switch strategies without rebuilding
or reloading existing ChatGPT tabs.
The `independent-virtual` strategy uses only LunaTOC prompt IDs, fingerprints,
an initial anchor hint, and adaptive relative feedback; it does not call the native
ChatGPT TOC or silently fall back to the legacy scanner. Confirmed successful
positions are persisted as bounded anchor hints. Anchors participate only in
the first rough estimate of each search. Later attempts move relative to the
latest recognized Prompt position so ChatGPT virtual-list coordinate rebuilds
cannot reactivate stale absolute coordinates.

---

## ADR 04: Persistent Prompts Manager ("My Prompts") and Autocompleter
* **Date**: 2026-06-19
* **Updated**: 2026-07-22

### Context
Users need a way to persistently save custom prompt templates (surviving browser restarts and tab closures), manage them inside the sidebar, quickly add existing prompts to their personal collection, and easily autocomplete/reuse them inside ChatGPT's text input box.

### Decision
1. **Persistent Storage**: Use `chrome.storage.local` to store templates under the key `chatToc:myPrompts` (re-adding `"storage"` permission in the manifest).
2. **Sorting & Filtering**: Provide 4 sorting filters (Alphabetical A-Z/Z-A, Update Time Asc/Desc) inside the My Prompts view.
3. **Right-Click Quick Add**: Intercept `contextmenu` events on the TOC list item and directly open the Create Custom Prompt modal pre-filled with the prompt's content, avoiding UI clutter from redundant hover buttons.
4. **Autocomplete Overlay**: Listen to the `input` event on ChatGPT's `#prompt-textarea`. Trigger autocomplete overlays on a slash command (`//` or `#`) or when matching prompt titles, and insert contents using `document.execCommand('insertText')` to integrate with React's state management.
5. **Autocomplete Ranking**: Match query text anywhere in prompt titles. Rank
   exact and word-prefix matches first, then usage count, last-used time, and
   title. With an empty query, rank by usage count, last-used time, and title.
   Store usage metadata separately from prompt content.

### Rationale
* Autocomplete increases text insertion speed and fits current typing workflows.
* Right-click straight to the creation modal reduces UI clutter in the sidebar.
* Storing prompts in `chrome.storage.local` matches the expectation of a permanent user-defined database, unlike session-bound states.
* Usage-aware ordering surfaces frequently selected prompts without allowing a
  weaker title match to outrank a stronger one.

### Consequences
* `"storage"` permission was restored in `manifest.json`.
* New file `myPrompts.js` was introduced to isolate prompts management and keep content.js focused on TOC layout.
* Usage metadata is local-only, is not included in prompt exports, and is
  removed on a best-effort basis when its prompt is deleted.

---

## ADR 05: Tab-Scoped Conversation TOC Cache
* **Date**: 2026-07-22

### Context
ChatGPT can restore previously visited conversations from client-side state
without returning another complete conversation mapping. Clearing the TOC on
every SPA route change therefore left revisited conversations without prompts
until a full page refresh.

### Decision
Cache each conversation's normalized user-prompt list and compact fingerprint
index in memory for the current content-script lifetime. Restore prompts
immediately on history navigation, generate fingerprints asynchronously, and
use snapshot revisions to reject stale generation results. Keep new-chat prompt
migration separate so temporary `WEB:` routes retain newly submitted prompts.

### Consequences
* Revisiting a conversation in the same tab restores its TOC immediately.
* Full Assistant responses are not cached; only bounded probes and hashes are.
* New conversation data invalidates the previous fingerprint index without
  delaying prompt rendering.
* Mounted Assistant DOM is collected after a short stabilization delay and
  upgrades the matching response from a derived to an observed fingerprint.
* Rendered messages without a known response ID mapping are ignored instead of
  guessing their prompt ownership.
* Observed DOM text keeps precedence for fingerprint content, while each new
  derived conversation payload remains authoritative for response-to-Prompt
  ownership. Out-of-range ownership is rejected before position matching.
* Virtual position observations use only Assistant elements intersecting the
  chat viewport; offscreen DOM retained by ChatGPT is not treated as visible.
* Independent jumps report success only when the target Prompt itself
  intersects the chat viewport; a retained offscreen Prompt DOM node cannot
  end search early or produce a confirmed anchor.
* ChatGPT response fingerprints use the same navigable Prompt IDs as the
  native TOC. Consecutive unanswered User messages excluded by the native
  Prompt model cannot shift every later response index.
* Independent navigation accepts only directly resolved Prompt DOM as a
  successful target. Assistant adjacency is not used to guess missing User
  ownership, preventing false highlights and confirmed anchors.
* Absolute anchors participate only in the initial estimate because virtual
  list rebuilds can change the relationship between old scroll coordinates and
  currently mounted content.
* After the first estimate, every plan starts from the current live scroll
  position. Consecutive observations provide an online pixels-per-Prompt
  estimate. Reliable learned estimates may use a larger movement cap while far
  from the target, then return to a smaller cap near the target. Unchanged
  positions grow the step and target crossings shrink and reverse it.
* Productive observations reset the consecutive no-progress counter. Searches
  may therefore continue beyond the former 12-scroll limit while still
  stopping after six unproductive attempts, 32 total attempts, or four seconds.
* An unresolved exact anchor at the current scroll position does not terminate
  with zero attempts. Targets near either list edge first move one viewport
  toward the interior, allowing the virtual list to mount before re-observation.
* If a later estimate reaches either scroll boundary and position recognition
  becomes unresolved, recovery also moves one viewport inward. The previous
  outward direction cannot terminate a search merely because the boundary
  clamps the next scroll position. Consecutive unresolved viewports retain
  that inward direction and share the normal no-progress budget instead of
  stopping under a separate two-observation limit.
* Once a target response is located without its Prompt DOM, a dedicated mount
  phase owns the search until completion or its bounded step limit. It scans
  relative to the current live scroll rather than an Assistant anchor captured
  before a virtual-list rebuild.
* Mount scanning grows while observations remain in the target response and
  reverses with half the step after crossing into the previous response,
  converging on the Prompt boundary without fixed-range assumptions.
* Prompt snapshots, fingerprints, and unconfirmed search observations are
  discarded on page refresh or tab close.
* Updating a Prompt snapshot keeps the previous complete derived and observed
  indexes readable until the matching revision finishes. Completed builds
  replace old derived data while retaining valid observed precedence.
* Confirmed successful jump anchors may persist in local extension storage as
  bounded hints. They are validated against prompt identity and viewport width,
  expire after 30 days, and never replace live position verification.
* Anchor-cache schema changes invalidate older persisted coordinates rather
  than allowing incompatible positions to influence new searches.
* Child-outline caches belong to a specific Prompt message ID rather than only
  its numeric list index. Virtual DOM replacement re-resolves headings by
  heading level, text, and duplicate occurrence; stale caches with no matching
  current headings are invalidated instead of rendering phantom child items.

## ADR 06: Vite-Based Extension Build
* **Date**: 2026-07-22
* **Updated**: 2026-07-22

### Context
The source was split into focused JavaScript files, but Manifest-declared
classic scripts depended on global `window.ChatToc...` APIs and an implicit
loading order. The growing script array made dependencies difficult to trace
and made later TypeScript adoption unnecessarily expensive.

### Decision
Use Vite with CRXJS to build the extension. Keep `src/content.ts` as the single
Isolated World source entry, and declare `src/page/pageHook.iife.ts` as a
separate `MAIN` world entry at `document_start`. Keep the root `manifest.json`
as the source Manifest and version authority; load the generated `dist/`
directory in Chrome.

Configure TypeScript with `allowJs` so modules can migrate incrementally. The
initial build migration preserves the existing internal global APIs; explicit
named imports and exports are a separate refactor.

The first incremental migration converts the four My Prompts modules to
TypeScript and named imports/exports. `applicationShell.js` now imports the
composed `myPrompts` API directly; unrelated feature globals remain until their
own focused migrations.

The second incremental migration converts conversation message normalization
and prompt marking to TypeScript. `navigatorController.js` imports those APIs
directly, while Outline imports the mark-state query and mark-change updates
are injected as a callback to avoid a circular module dependency.

The third incremental migration converts Follow, Jump, and Outline to
TypeScript. `navigatorController.js` imports their named APIs directly, and the
navigation dependency chain is explicit: Outline depends on Jump, and Jump
depends on Follow.

The fourth incremental migration converts Tooltip, Toggle Button, and Sidebar
Visibility to TypeScript. The application shell and tooltip consumers import
their named APIs directly instead of reading UI helpers from `window`.

The fifth incremental migration converts the Content entry, Application Shell,
and Navigator Controller to TypeScript. `content.ts` calls the exported
application initializer, and the shell imports the controller directly.

The sixth incremental migration converts the Popup and Main World page hook to
TypeScript. With every executable file under `src/` migrated, JavaScript is now
generated only as a build artifact in `dist/`.

The tooling migration converts `vite.config.js` and `scripts/version.js` to
TypeScript. Node-side files use a dedicated strict `tsconfig.node.json`, and
`tsx` runs the npm version lifecycle without changing the public versioning
commands. A post-build naming step removes `.ts` and `.html` from generated
entry chunk names after CRXJS has completed its own bundle and Manifest work.

### Consequences
* Feature source files no longer need individual entries in `manifest.json`.
* The page hook is injected directly by Chrome instead of through a DOM script
  element created by the application shell.
* Development and release installation require `npm run build` and loading
  `dist/` in Chrome.
* `dist/` and `node_modules/` remain untracked generated directories.
* Future JavaScript-to-TypeScript migration can proceed one module at a time.
* My Prompts no longer publishes internal modules or its composed API on
  `window`.
* Conversation message and prompt-mark modules no longer publish APIs on
  `window`.
* Follow, Jump, and Outline no longer publish APIs on `window` or depend on
  source-script loading order.
* Tooltip, Toggle Button, and Sidebar Visibility no longer publish APIs on
  `window` or require side-effect imports from the Content Script entry.
* The Isolated World source graph no longer publishes custom APIs on `window`;
  only the compiled JavaScript bundle is executed by Chrome.
* `allowJs` is no longer needed in the TypeScript configuration because no
  executable JavaScript remains under `src/`.
* Browser code, build configuration, and release tooling are all type-checked.
* Generated entry files use clean names such as `content-<hash>.js` and
  `popup-<hash>.js` while Chrome continues to load only JavaScript from `dist/`.

## ADR 07: Incremental React UI Foundation
* **Date**: 2026-07-22

### Context
The extension's imperative DOM code and single large stylesheet make increasingly
stateful interfaces harder to maintain, but a full UI rewrite would add unnecessary
risk to the existing navigation and My Prompts behavior.

### Decision
Adopt React 19 incrementally with Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui using Base UI.
Keep all React components under `src/components`, with shadcn primitives in
`components/ui` and future shared or feature-specific components in sibling
directories. Map `@/` to the complete `src/` directory.

Keep Tailwind out of the document-level Content Script styles. Load its
compiled stylesheet as an inline string inside a dedicated React Shadow Root,
and scope shadcn theme variables to `.luna-toc-ui`. Keep React portals inside
the same Shadow Root. Existing DOM features and CSS remain in place until each
interface is migrated behind that React boundary.

### Consequences
* React interfaces can be migrated one at a time without rewriting the content
  script or existing feature logic.
* Tailwind and shadcn generated rules cannot modify ChatGPT's document styles.
* Every React mount container must live inside the Shadow Root and include the
  `.luna-toc-ui` class.
* Tailwind class prefixes are unnecessary because the Shadow Root provides the
  CSS boundary.
* Dialogs, popovers, tooltips, and other portals must target the Portal
  container provided by the React host instead of `document.body`.
* Existing relative imports can remain; new modules may use the project-wide
  `@/` alias.
* The My Prompts create/edit dialog is the first migrated React interface. Its
  controller bridges the legacy `showDialog()` API to React, while prompt
  persistence remains in `promptLibrary.ts`.
* The My Prompts composer suggestion menu is rendered by React inside the same
  Shadow Root. Trigger parsing, caret positioning data, keyboard handling, and
  prompt insertion remain in `promptAutocomplete.ts`.
* Autocomplete rows show titles only for faster scanning; prompt content is
  available through the native hover title.

---

## ADR 08: React Popup and Follow-ChatGPT Theme
* **Date**: 2026-07-22

### Context
The static Popup exposed separate Dark and Light buttons and required users to
choose an extension theme independently from ChatGPT. ChatGPT exposes its
resolved theme through the `light` or `dark` class on the document root.

### Decision
Render the Popup with React while preserving its existing Tips and Note visual
design. Store a theme preference containing a follow-ChatGPT flag and the last
manual Dark/Light choice. Detect and observe ChatGPT's root class in the Content
Script, and share the latest resolved theme with the Popup through
`chrome.storage.local`.

Keep existing users on their saved manual theme during migration. Default new
users to following ChatGPT. Present manual Dark/Light selection as one toggle
button and disable it while following ChatGPT.

### Consequences
* ChatGPT theme changes update LunaTOC immediately when following is enabled.
* Disabling follow mode restores the user's last manual theme.
* The Popup is now a React entry styled with Tailwind utilities; `popup.css`
  remains the Tailwind entry and retains only theme tokens and document-level
  base rules.
* No additional extension permissions are required.

---

## ADR 09: Navigation Feature Boundary
* **Date**: 2026-07-24

### Context
Main-prompt navigation, child-outline navigation, outline rendering, and
sidebar follow behavior were split across root-level feature files. The main
jump implementation also prioritizes ChatGPT's native prompt navigator, which
we intend to replace independently later.

### Decision
Group the complete TOC navigation feature under `features/navigation`.
Separate main-prompt navigation in `promptNavigation.ts`, child-heading
navigation in `outlineNavigation.ts`, child-outline extraction and display in
`outline.ts`, and follow policy in `follow.ts`.

Keep the current navigation algorithm unchanged during this move. Callers use
the stable exports from `promptNavigation.ts`, allowing its native-first
implementation to be replaced without changing the navigator or outline UI.

### Consequences
* Navigation-related files no longer add to the `features` root.
* A displayed child outline remains the prerequisite for initiating a child
  jump, while `outlineNavigation.ts` handles headings later virtualized away.
* Main-prompt algorithm replacement is isolated from child-outline display and
  sidebar follow behavior.

---

## ADR 10: Platform-Independent Navigation Data
* **Date**: 2026-07-24

### Context
Future position-based navigation should work with ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and
other AI pages whose conversation payloads and role fields differ. Fingerprints
also need stable AI text rather than platform-specific attachments or tool
output.

### Decision
Represent navigation input as generic prompt/response turns. Keep conversion
from ChatGPT's active conversation branch in a platform adapter, and retain only
visible Assistant text for future fingerprint generation. Exclude tool messages,
attachments, and structured non-text content.

Generate at most the configured number of fingerprints per response. Normalize
raw and rendered content into comparable Unicode letters and numbers, removing
Markdown image/link payloads, URLs, and formatting symbols. Distribute samples
across long responses, use a short plain-text probe for fast lookup, and verify
ambiguous matches with a SHA-256 hash of the following bounded text. Build the
conversation index in bounded batches and yield to the event loop between
batches so long conversations do not monopolize the Content Script's main
thread. Match rendered text by locating probes first, verifying their trailing
hashes, and accepting a prompt only when it has a unique highest
verified-fingerprint count.

Prepare derived viewport-segment fingerprints separately from the active
navigation index. Estimate visual rows from source newlines and long-line
wrapping, group them into overlapping 0.75-viewport sections, and cap each
response at 20 segments. For mounted responses, measure real Markdown-container
height and use DOM Range character geometry to create observed segments at the
same viewport spacing, recording the viewport dimensions that produced them.
The ChatGPT runtime builds derived Segments asynchronously from conversation
text and matches them against viewport-only rendered text. A matched Segment
contributes a fractional logical coordinate formed from `promptIndex` plus its
`positionRatio`; whole-response fingerprints and platform response IDs remain
fallbacks. Observed DOM Segment measurement stays disabled so MutationObserver
updates cannot trigger repeated synchronous Range geometry work.

Keep rendered-text extraction in platform adapters. The ChatGPT adapter reads
only mounted Assistant-owned Markdown containers, combines multiple Markdown
blocks belonging to one response, and excludes nested tool or attachment UI.

Keep one active fingerprint record per response. Mark records derived from raw
conversation data as `derived` and records created from rendered content as
`observed`. An observed record replaces a derived record for the same response,
while later derived updates cannot replace an observed record. Preserve observed
records across snapshot revisions, then discard records whose response IDs are
absent when the new derived index completes.

### Consequences
* Fingerprint and search modules can operate without ChatGPT data types.
* Supporting another AI page requires a new adapter rather than changes to the
  navigation algorithm.
* Fingerprints contain only bounded text probes and hashes rather than complete
  AI responses.
* Derived raw text and observed rendered text share the same lightweight
  comparable-text transformation without requiring a Markdown renderer.
* Each non-empty response has at most one active fingerprint record containing
  its `responseId`, `promptIndex`, quality, and bounded fingerprints.
* Matching still aggregates verified response records by `promptIndex`.
* Equally strong prompt matches are reported as ambiguous instead of selecting
  an arbitrary navigation target.
* Visible-position resolution tries generic fingerprints before using a
  platform response ID as fallback, allowing each future platform adapter to
  provide its own optional identity mechanism.
* When a response resolves to the target Prompt index but the platform's Prompt
  DOM is not visible, the generic controller first aligns the response's
  observed top anchor. If that anchor cannot move the viewport further,
  ChatGPT searches one viewport upward because its user Prompt precedes the
  Assistant response.
* Relative probes scale linearly with the fractional logical Prompt distance,
  capped at 32 viewports. Sub-Prompt Segment distances use one viewport, while
  repeated observations of the same response retain the existing bounded
  attempt-based growth.
* Existing prompt extraction and navigation behavior remain unchanged until
  the generic model is connected in a later step.

## ADR 11: Platform Abstraction Interface

**Date:** 2026-08-25

### Context

ADR 10 normalized the *navigation data layer* (turn shape, fingerprint shape,
prompt navigation surface) so it no longer hard-codes ChatGPT. But the page-hook
(IIFE in MAIN world), the content-script controller, the chatgpt runtime
config, theme detection, and the postMessage channel strings were all still
ChatGPT-specific. Adding Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, or Anthropic Claude
web-chat meant editing the same handful of files again and risking name
collisions on the postMessage channels.

The interface and discovery surface for "which AI page is this?" therefore
needs to be a first-class concept with one canonical entry point.

### Decision

Introduce a `Platform` interface in
[`src/platforms/platformInterface.ts`](../src/platforms/platformInterface.ts)
as the hard contract every host adapter must implement. Resolve the active
platform exactly once at startup with
[`getActivePlatform(host = window.location.host)`](../src/platforms/index.ts);
that function is the only host-detection site in the codebase. The page-hook
entry and the content-script controller read all per-platform behavior through
`platform.pageHook.*`, `platform.navigation.*`, `platform.contentCapture.*`,
`platform.diagnostics.*`, `platform.config.*`, and `platform.messages.*`.

Each host owns its own namespace of postMessage channel strings (e.g.
`CHATGPT_CONVERSATION_DATA`, `COPILOT_CONVERSATION_DATA`) so two adapters can
never collide.

The ChatGPT adapter under [`src/platforms/chatgpt/`](../src/platforms/chatgpt/)
*wraps* the existing modules rather than rewriting them — behavior is
unchanged. A Copilot placeholder lives under
[`src/platforms/copilot/`](../src/platforms/copilot/) where every method
throws `Error('Copilot platform not yet implemented')`, so any accidental
branch into the Copilot path fails with a recognizable, identifiable error
instead of `undefined.foo`. `APP_CONFIG` becomes a
`Record<PlatformId, PlatformConfigBlock>` so navigationAlgorithm,
promptTopOffsetPx, settleAttempts, backfillMaxPages, interceptFetchNumTurns,
contract slots, and selectors are per-platform.

Runtime overrides migrate from `chatGptRuntimeConfig` to
`luna:chatgpt:runtimeConfig`. The legacy key is read once on first load and
forwarded to the new key, then deleted. The legacy key is preserved for one
release.

Out of scope for this PR:

- Actually implementing Copilot / Gemini / Claude adapters. Only the placeholder exists.
- Renaming ChatGPT internal symbols (e.g. `getConversationIdFromApiPath`).
  ChatGPT is the wrapped adapter; renaming it would expand the diff and risk
  existing tests.
- MyPrompts composer textarea selector abstraction. Still hardcoded
  `#prompt-textarea`.
- Native TOC button selectors. Still hardcoded in
  `chatgpt/nativePromptNavigation.ts`.
- Auto-generating `manifest.json` matches from `Platform.matches`. The
  manifest is hand-synced for now; a follow-up lets `vite.config.ts` merge
  `platform.matches` into the build output.

### Consequences

- Adding a new platform is a single `src/platforms/<host>/index.ts` that
  exports a `Platform` record and a one-line `PLATFORMS` push in
  `src/platforms/index.ts`. No edits to `pageHook.iife.ts`,
  `navigatorController.ts`, or `applicationShell.ts`.
- The postMessage channel namespace is no longer a single set of strings; each
  platform owns its own and consumers ask `platform.messages.*` instead of
  importing a constant.
- `promptNavigation.ts` had 11 chatgpt-specific imports reduced to one
  `getActivePlatform()` call. The wrappers in that file are deliberately
  lazy (`function platform() { return getActivePlatform(); }`) so that vitest
  in a non-chatgpt host can import the module without throwing at load.
- `APP_CONFIG` selectors live in `platform.config.selectors.*`, removing
  scattered string literals like
  `'[data-message-author-role="user"]'` from `navigatorController.ts` and
  friends.
- `Manifest.json` now lists `https://copilot.microsoft.com/*` in both MAIN
  and ISOLATED match arrays so the placeholder can be smoke-tested; expect
  `Error('Copilot platform not yet implemented')` if Copilot code paths run.

## ADR 12: Local Smart Labels and Independent Color Palettes

**Date:** 2026-09-10
**Updated:** 2026-09-12

### Context

Short prompts such as "continue", "okay", or "why" are poor navigation labels,
but sending conversation content to an LLM would add privacy, permission, and
operational costs. Users also need stable labels across visits and color choices
that better match ChatGPT than the original Luna Blue palette.

### Decision

Keep Raw prompt text as the default TOC mode and add an explicit Smart mode.
Smart mode uses a conservative deterministic reply classifier. It distinguishes
continuation, acknowledgement, clarification, uncertainty, option-shaped
choices, informative prompts, and unknown text. Exact short triggers and a
small set of verified colloquial forms remain high-confidence seeds. Decorative
emoji may be ignored only after a contextual signal is recognized. Attachments,
code, URLs, specific questions, concrete actions, and meaningful remaining
content protect the original Prompt. A bare letter or number is only an option
candidate; it is not a choice without one unambiguous preceding question group.

Build bounded candidates from the current final answer's Markdown headings and
explicitly introduced topics, plus the preceding final answer's explicit
question and complete option groups. Bind evidence according to reply type:
continuations prefer current topics, choices require the selected option,
uncertainty retains an undecided attitude, and clarifications may reuse one
explicit preceding question. Reject missing, incomplete, generic, overlong,
format-damaged, or ambiguous evidence. Generated labels are display metadata
only; original text and message IDs remain authoritative for navigation,
previews, search, and saved prompts.

Persist generated labels in `chrome.storage.local` by conversation/message ID.
Each record includes algorithm version 4, a compact source revision signature,
and decision type so regenerated answers, branch changes, prompt changes, and
algorithm upgrades invalidate stale derived labels. Do not persist source
Prompt or Assistant text. Incomplete sources remain raw and are not cached.
Keep the provisional bounds at 50 conversations, 500 labels per conversation,
and 180 days since last access, and expose a clear-cache action.

Separate resolved appearance (`light`/`dark` and Follow ChatGPT) from the color
palette. Keep Luna Blue and add ChatGPT Warm, Sage, Violet, and Custom. Custom
accepts validated six-digit hexadecimal background, text, and accent colors.

Completion and compression are independent decisions. Contextual completion may
use the current and preceding Prompt/Assistant turns, but every accepted relation
must retain message-bound evidence. Ordinary task sentences are eligible evidence;
Markdown formatting only affects ranking. Long informative Prompts and completed
labels use the same fidelity-checked compression candidates. Browser layout selects
only among those candidates and keeps the complete semantic label when none fits.

Developer diagnosis uses a bounded, deduplicated in-memory trace with explicit
stage states and reason codes. It is not persisted, uploaded, or exposed in the
user-facing sidebar. The local replay script and reviewed fixtures are development
and regression data, not an unseen test set.

### Consequences

- Smart Label generation and storage require no network request or new permission.
- A generated label remains stable only while its complete source input and algorithm version remain unchanged.
- Smart results are intentionally conservative and may fall back to raw text.
- Compound prompts with a concrete topic or action remain raw even when they contain continuation or acknowledgement language.
- Missing, incomplete, weak, or ambiguous evidence retains the raw Prompt.
- A unique preceding option group may resolve bare selections and uncertainty without confusing prose such as "Project B" with option key B.
- Search matches both the visible Smart Label and the original Prompt.
- Smart Labels use two display lines, and hover previews show the full label plus original Prompt.
- A promoted answer heading is omitted from the child outline to avoid duplicate hierarchy.
- Cache schema version 4 invalidates earlier labels, requires a verifiable source signature, and invalidates individual records when any consumed local context changes.
- Preset and Custom palettes do not alter navigation behavior.
- Palette and cache controls are available from a visible sidebar gear as well as the extension popup.

### Follow-up

- Reassess the provisional 50-conversation, 500-label, and 180-day cache limits using real storage usage and privacy feedback before treating them as durable product defaults.
